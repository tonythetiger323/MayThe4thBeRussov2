The original MayThe4thBeRusso repository is for a project for my class which, I have now completed and graduated from. MayThe4thBeRussov2 is now the real development of the actual wedding website that I am making for my best friend, Randy Russo and his beautiful and amazing fiance, Megan Bailey. I couldn't be prouder or happier to be able to create this site for them as their wedding gift.
